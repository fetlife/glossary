# FetLife / Glossary
### [**Kinktionary**](https://fetlife.com/glossary): More like guidelines and a lot less like definitions.

### Surgeon General's Warning
> These are **more like guidelines and a lot less like definitions**. Each person is unique and only through getting to know someone will you understand what it means for that person to associate with a specific role, orientation, etc.

### Contributing Guidelines
> The list of terms and definitions (guidelines) are maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/fetlife/glossary). You can always suggest improvements by creating an [issue](https://github.com/fetlife/glossary/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/fetlife/glossary/pulls).

### Suggesting New Roles
